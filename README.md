I wrote this aplication because I was having issues trying to disconnect many visual studio solutions from TFS. I had copied a large directory under source control, with many projects, to another folder. 
I then used the unbind options in VS, but the projects still gave me a pop up that they were binded to TFS. 

I had to manually remove the "TeamFoundationVersionControl" section from every ".sln" file in order for the popups to stop. 
So, I wrote this C# application to automatically take care of that and made it configurable so that it can be used for other tasks.

This is a console app. A typical example of calling it would be: RemoveSectionsFromFiles.exe -d "C:\Test" -p"*.sln" -o"TeamFoundationVersionControl" -c"EndGlobalSection".
This execution would traverse the directory specified in -d. It would look for every file matching the pattern in -p, which in this example is ".sln" files. 
It would then use the -o option and find the string as the first line of the section it will remove.
It then uses the -c option as the last line of the section it will remove. It then removes that section from the file. 

It also creates a backup of every file it modified in the format "NameOfSolution.sln.20240423_094915.backup".
The files are updated in parallel, so the execution should be fast. 

Please use with caution since I've only applied it to my specific use case of removing TeamFoundationVersionControl from Solution files.
